        <h2>How Organ Donation Works</h2>
        <p>Organ donation is the process of surgically removing an organ or tissue from one person, known as the donor, and placing it into another person, known as the recipient. This can be done to save the life of someone who has a damaged organ. Here’s a brief overview of the process:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Registration</h3>
        <p>Individuals can register as organ donors at any time, either online or through their local health department. It's important to discuss your decision with family and friends.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Organ Matching</h3>
        <p>When a donor passes away, medical professionals determine the suitability of their organs for transplantation. Potential recipients are matched based on various factors such as blood type, tissue type, and the urgency of their medical needs.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Transplantation</h3>
        <p>Once a match is found, the recipient undergoes surgery to receive the donated organ. The transplant process is highly coordinated and involves multiple healthcare professionals.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Post-Transplant Care</h3>
        <p>After the surgery, the recipient will need ongoing medical care, including medications to prevent organ rejection and regular check-ups to monitor their health.</p>
        
        <h3>Benefits of Organ Donation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Saves lives by providing essential organs for those in need.</li>
            <li>Improves the quality of life for recipients.</li>
            <li>Can lead to medical advancements in transplant technologies.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Becoming an organ donor is a selfless act that can make a significant impact on many lives. For more information on how to register, visit our <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page.</p>

        <p>Despite the clear benefits of organ donation, several myths can deter people from registering. Here are some common myths and the facts that dispel them:</p>
        <h3>Myth 1: If I register as a donor, doctors won’t try to save my life.</h3>

        <h3>Myth 4: I can't be a donor if I have a health condition.</h3>
        <p>Fact: Many health conditions do not prevent you from donating organs. Each case is evaluated individually.</p>
